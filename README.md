# Self-Healing Time Machine ⏳

A **GitHub app** that updates itself daily by setting the date in `date.txt`.
Think of it as a **time traveler** that **fixes time** every day.

## 🛠 How It Works
- Every **midnight UTC**, GitHub Actions runs the script.
- The script updates `date.txt` with today's date.
- If the date has changed, it **commits & pushes** the change.
- This triggers CI workflows, making the repo "self-healing."

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated time correction** ⏰
- **Trigger GitHub CI/CD workflows** 🔄
- **Works without human intervention** 🤖

## 📌 Setup
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/self-healing-git.git
   cd self-healing-git
